# Log

_Chronological continuity log. Decisions, stop points, what changed and why._
_Not a task tracker — that's backlog.md. Keep entries concise and dated._

## Recent Decisions

_Log significant choices here so they survive context resets._

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Promote multi-repo composition to first-class `WorkScopeManifest` (manifest_kind: work_scope). v0.9.0 ships transitional support; project+includes still loads with DeprecationWarning. v1.0.0 will hard-fail. | Overloading `manifest_kind: project` for shells blurred the trust posture — a shell composes, a project describes. Distinct kind + schema + provenance (Source.WORK_SCOPE) prevents semantic drift and enables strict slot validation in OC settings. | 2026-05-08 |

## Stop Points

_Where did you leave off? What should be verified next session?_

## Notes

_Free-form scratch. Clear periodically — old entries can be deleted once no longer relevant._
