# Log

_Chronological continuity log. Decisions, stop points, what changed and why._
_Not a task tracker — that's backlog.md. Keep entries concise and dated._

## Recent Decisions

_Log significant choices here so they survive context resets._

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Promote multi-repo composition to first-class `WorkScopeManifest` (manifest_kind: work_scope). v0.9.0 ships transitional support; project+includes still loads with DeprecationWarning. v1.0.0 will hard-fail. | Overloading `manifest_kind: project` for shells blurred the trust posture — a shell composes, a project describes. Distinct kind + schema + provenance (Source.WORK_SCOPE) prevents semantic drift and enables strict slot validation in OC settings. | 2026-05-08 |
| Ship worked examples in `examples/{single_project,work_scope}/` and validate them in CI. README + OC operator docs migrated to v0.9 vocabulary. | An operator authoring their first manifest needs a runnable starting point that's kept fresh by CI, not a copy-paste blob in markdown that rots. The examples pin v0.9 platform_manifest constraints, exercise both manifest kinds, and the CI step `validate-examples` ensures schema/loader changes can't silently break authoring guidance. | 2026-05-08 |
